# CSMA

SourceCode and detailed report on One, Non and P-persistent CSMA techniques

* You need to simulate the project according to the following rules.

    1. change values of variables in ```const.py``` according to your wish. (Specially ```total_sender_number``` and ```total_receiver_number```).\
    Don't forget to modify the ```outfile_path``` also.

    2. You need to create as many number of input files in ```src/textfiles/input/``` as the integer value you store in ```total_sender_number```\
    variable in ```const.py```, otherwise the prpgram will throw exceptions and desired results won't show up.

    3. After you've followed *STEP-1* and *STEP-2*, move to the ```src``` folder and run ```python3 main.py``` after deleting the\
     ```src/textfiles/report.txt``` and ```src/textfiles/analysis.txt``` files.

    4. Keep your eyes on the newly generated ```analysis.txt``` and ```report.txt``` after choosing your desired CSMA technique from the command line.
